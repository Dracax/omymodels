**v0.6.0**
1. O!MyModels now also can generate python Dataclass from DDL. Use argument models_type='dataclass' or if you use the cli flag --models_type dataclass or -m dataclass
2. Added ForeignKey generation to GinoORM Models

**v0.5.0**
1. Added Enums/IntEnums types for Gino & Pydantic
2. Added UUID type
3. Added key `schema_global` in create_models method (by default schema_global = True). 
If you set schema_global=False schema if it exists in ddl will be defined for each table (model) in table args.
This way you can have differen schemas per model (table). By default schema_global=True - this mean for all 
table only one schema and it is defined in `db = Gino(schema="prefix--schema-name")`.
4. If column is a primary key (primary_key=True) nullable argument not showed, because primary keys always are not null.
5. To cli was added flag '--no-global-schema' to set schema in table_args.
